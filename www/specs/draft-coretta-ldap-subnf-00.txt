Abstract

   This informational Internet-Draft (I-D) extends a single name form

1.  Introduction

   Directory implementations which actively enforce any number of DIT
   structure rules while also managing subentries as described within
   Section 2.4 of [RFC 3672], perhaps as collections for [RFC 3671]
   collective types, may trigger naming violations following an attempt
   to create additional subentries.

   This I-D seeks to mitigate this difficulty by extending a general-use
   name form definition which can be employed by way of the schema to
   extend the naming policy enforced by a DIT structure rule to include
   subentries.

1.1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
   in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in
   all capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Acronyms Used

      DIT    Directory Information Tree
      LDAP   Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
      RDN    Relative Distinguished Name
      OID    ASN.1 Object Identifier

1.3.  Allocations

   This I-D operates within the following OID structure.

     - 1.3.6.1.4.1.56521                           ; author root
     - 1.3.6.1.4.1.56521.9 (general-use)
     - 1.3.6.1.4.1.56521.9.4 (directory-services)
     - 1.3.6.1.4.1.56521.9.4.8 (schema)
     - 1.3.6.1.4.1.56521.9.4.8.6 (nameForms)

   Should this I-D be elevated to RFC status, the leaf node assigned to
   the name form definition in Section 2 shall be made OBSOLETE in favor
   of an IANA-assigned OID, at which point this I-D will be updated to
   only reference the literal 'IANA-ASSIGNED-OID' placeholder prefix,
   where appropriate.

1.4.  About Name Forms and DIT Structure Rules

   A name form schema definition, as described in Section 4.1.7.2 of
   [RFC 4512], is used to declare a constraint to be applied to the RDN
   of new or relocated entries within a DIT which bear the STRUCTURAL
   class noted in the name form's OC clause.

   A DIT structure rule schema definition, per Section 4.1.7.1 of [RFC
   4512], enforces the name form specified within its FORM clause upon
   qualifying entries within the relevant DIT branch or administrative
   area.

2.  'subentryForm'

   The 'subentryForm' name form definition manifests as follows:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.56521.9.4.8.6.1
          NAME 'subentryForm'
          OC subentry
          MUST cn )

   The name form bears the STRUCTURAL 'subentry' class reference as its
   OC clause value, meaning that it is meant to refer to entries which
   bear that class within the context enforced by a referencing DIT
   structure rule.

   Furthermore, the 'cn' attribute type defined within Section 2.3 of
   [RFC 4519] that is REQUIRED under all circumstances by the 'subentry'
   class is now also REQUIRED for use as the principal RDN type.

   As a simple example, consider this hypothetical structure rule:

      ( 242
          NAME 'subentryStructure'
          FORM subentryForm
          SUP ( 0 1 ) )

    This hypothetical rule states that any entries that are presently
    being governed by superior structure rules zero (0) OR one (1) may
    allow the creation of subordinate 'subentry' entries.

    Please note that the nature of DIT structure rules allows for
    significant variations in composition and design across differing
    directory tree structures and, thus, the above example rule may
    not effectively support all use-cases as-is.
